# GameOfLife
An implementation of John Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.

This implementation assumes that the "world" is like a globe and so wraps around the edges. It also assumes that the world fits on the whole canvas. Therfore, the size of the cells scales with how large the world is in terms of rows and columns.
