# GameOfLife
An implementation of John Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.

This implementation assumes that the "world" is like a globe and so wraps around the edges. It also assumes that the world fits on the whole canvas. Therfore, the size of the cells scales with how large the world is in terms of rows and columns.

The code is contained in the src folder, while the test folder contains a html and js file to see 3 different seeded games in action. 

These are :

1. Blinker
2. Toad
3. Beacon

You can read about the Game of Life concept and see more seeded games on its Wikipedia [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
